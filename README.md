1. Understand Your Data and Objective

Objective: Predict whether a company is bankrupt (Bankrupt?) based on financial ratios and metrics.

Data: 96 financial features per company.
2. Data Preprocessing

Before feature selection, ensure your data is clean:

    Handle Missing Values: Decide on strategies for missing data (e.g., imputation, removal).
    Normalize/Scale Data: Some algorithms require scaled data for optimal performance.
    Encode Categorical Variables: If any features are categorical, encode them appropriately.

3. Feature Selection Techniques
A. Remove Constant and Quasi-Constant Features

    Constant Features: Features that have the same value for all records.
    Quasi-Constant Features: Features that have the same value for a large majority of records (e.g., 99%).

Action: Identify and remove these features as they provide little to no information.
B. Correlation Analysis

    Purpose: Identify and remove redundant features that are highly correlated with each other.
    Method:
        Compute the correlation matrix for all features.
        Set a correlation threshold (e.g., 0.9).
        For each pair of features with correlation above the threshold, keep one.

Tools: Use statistical software or programming languages (e.g., Python's pandas, NumPy) to compute correlations.
C. Univariate Feature Selection

    Purpose: Assess each feature individually to see how strongly it relates to the target variable.
    Methods:
        Statistical Tests: Use tests like Chi-squared, ANOVA F-test, or mutual information.
        SelectKBest: Select top K features based on the statistical test scores.

Action: Rank features based on their scores and select the top ones.
D. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

    Purpose: Select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets.
    Method:
        Choose a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
        Use RFE to select features by recursively removing the least important ones.

Tools: Scikit-learn's RFE class.
E. Feature Importance from Tree-Based Models

    Purpose: Use models that provide feature importance scores.
    Method:
        Train a model like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
        Extract feature importance scores.
        Select top features based on importance.

Action: Keep features with higher importance scores.
F. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

    Purpose: Reduce dimensionality by transforming features into a lower number of principal components.
    Note: PCA creates new features (components), which are combinations of original features. This may make interpretation harder.

Action: Use PCA if feature interpretability is less critical.
4. Domain Knowledge

    Leverage Financial Expertise: Some features may be known to be more predictive of bankruptcy.
    Identify Key Ratios: Ratios like liquidity ratios, solvency ratios, profitability ratios are often crucial.

Action: Prioritize features that are commonly used in financial analysis for bankruptcy prediction.
5. Iterative Process

    Model Evaluation: After selecting features, build models and evaluate their performance.
    Adjust Feature Set: If performance is not satisfactory, revisit feature selection.

Action: Iterate the process, possibly combining different feature selection methods.
6. Suggested Features to Consider

Based on financial analysis principles, consider including the following types of features:

    Liquidity Ratios:
        Current Ratio
        Quick Ratio
        Working Capital to Total Assets

    Profitability Ratios:
        ROA (Return on Assets)
        Operating Profit Rate
        Net Income to Total Assets

    Leverage Ratios:
        Debt Ratio %
        Total Debt/Total Net Worth
        Liability to Equity

    Efficiency Ratios:
        Total Asset Turnover
        Inventory Turnover Rate
        Accounts Receivable Turnover

    Cash Flow Indicators:
        Cash Flow to Sales
        Cash Flow to Total Assets
        Cash Flow Per Share

    Growth Indicators:
        Total Asset Growth Rate
        Net Value Growth Rate
        Operating Profit Growth Rate

    Market Value Ratios:
        Net Value Per Share
        Earnings Per Share (EPS)

    Other Key Ratios:
        Interest Coverage Ratio
        Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL)
        Retained Earnings to Total Assets

7. Example of Feature Reduction

Here's how you might reduce features step by step:
Step 1: Remove Redundant Features

    Highly Correlated Features: For example, if Quick Assets/Total Assets and Quick Assets/Current Liability are highly correlated, keep one.

Step 2: Select Key Financial Ratios

    From Each Category:
        Liquidity: Current Ratio
        Profitability: ROA, Net Income to Total Assets
        Leverage: Debt Ratio %
        Efficiency: Total Asset Turnover

Step 3: Use Feature Importance Scores

    Train a Random Forest Model:
        Get feature importance scores.
        Select top 25-50 features based on these scores.

8. Finalizing the Feature Set

    Ensure Diversity: Include features from different categories to capture various aspects of financial health.
    Avoid Overfitting: Be cautious of selecting too many features based on one model's importance scores.

9. Validate Your Feature Set

    Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance.
    Hold-Out Test Set: Validate the model on unseen data to ensure generalizability.

10. Documentation

    Keep Records: Document the feature selection process and rationale.
    Explainability: Be prepared to explain why certain features were selected or removed.
